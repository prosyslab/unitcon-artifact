= Spring HATEOAS

This project provides some APIs to ease creating REST representations that follow the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS[HATEOAS] principle when working with Spring and especially Spring MVC. The core problem it tries to address is link creation and representation assembly.

== Working with Spring HATEOAS

Since all commits are headlined with its github issue, git will treat it as a comment. To get around this, apply the following configuration to your clone:

[source]
----
git config core.commentchar "/"
----

== Making a release

1. Create a new release (on the main branch).
+
----
% ci/create-release.sh <release ticket without hash> <release version> <next snapshot version>
----
+
2. With the release tagged, push the tagged version to the release branch.
+
----
% git checkout -b release
% git reset --hard <tag>
% git push -f origin release
----

NOTE: You can chain the previous set of commands together using `&&`.

The pipeline will build and release the "release" branch. It will also build a new snapshot and stage it on artifactory.
And if it's a `.RELEASE`, the pipeline will push it out to Maven Central. To complete a release on Maven Central, you must login
to the server shown in `pom.xml`, close, and release. This is a stop gap to guard against bad releases accidentally getting pushed
out to Maven Central.

=== Running CI tasks locally

Since the pipeline uses Docker, it's easy to:

* Debug what went wrong on your local machine.
* Test out a a tweak to your `test.sh` script before sending it out.
* Experiment against a new image before submitting your pull request.

All of these use cases are great reasons to essentially run what Jenkins does on your local machine.

IMPORTANT: To do this you must have Docker installed on your machine.

1. `docker run -it --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)",target=/spring-hateoas-github adoptopenjdk/openjdk8:latest /bin/bash`
+
This will launch the Docker image and mount your source code at `spring-hateoas-github`.
+
2. `cd spring-hateoas-github`
+
Next, run the `test.sh` script from inside the container:
+
2. `PROFILE=none ci/test.sh`

Since the container is binding to your source, you can make edits from your IDE and continue to run build jobs.

If you need to test the `build.sh` script, then do this:

1. `docker run -it --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)",target=/spring-hateoas-github --mount type=bind,source="/tmp/spring-hateoas-artifactory",target=/spring-hateoas-artifactory adoptopenjdk/openjdk8:latest /bin/bash`
+
This will launch the Docker image and mount your source code at `spring-hateoas-github` and the temporary
artifactory output directory at `spring-hateoas-artifactory`.
+
Next, run the `build.sh` script from inside the container:
+
2. `ci/build.sh`

IMPORTANT: `build.sh` will attempt to push to Artifactory. If you don't supply credentials, it will fail.

NOTE: Docker containers can eat up disk space fast! From time to time, run `docker system prune` to clean out old images.
