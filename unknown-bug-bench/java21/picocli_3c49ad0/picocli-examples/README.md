# Picocli Examples

This subproject contains runnable examples demonstrating picocliâ€™s features and capabilities. 

Most of the examples are in individual source files in the `src` directory.

Additionally the `annotation-processing` directory contains some mini projects with Maven and Gradle build configurations to activate the `picocli-codegen` annotation processor during the build. 

This subproject does not publish any artifacts.
